    <para>This is a list of users who will be granted 
    administrative privileges on the share. This means that they 
    will be allowed to perform any file operation irrespective of
    POSIX or NT file permissions. Internally, this is implemented
    by running as root.</para>

    <para>Although new files and directories are created by root,
    their POSIX owner is set to the uid of the user (unless the
    owner is inherited - see <smbconfoption name="inherit owner"/>)
    </para>

    <para>You should use this option very carefully.</para>
